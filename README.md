# blogatron

This is the code that runs on blog.verture.net. It looks terrible, and it is terrible. Built as a way for me to learn some basic PHP and MySQL, and move off Movable Type which I initially used.

Features that I tried to learn when building this
  * Writing and editing written posts
  * Draft functionality
  * Simple search function
  * Enable and disable comments
  * Edit date of posted entry
  * slug functionality on individual posts

I probably wouldn't fork it if I were you. I'm still learning how to code.
