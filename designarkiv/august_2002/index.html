<h2>Get your Alcatel drivers here!</h2>
<a name="000348"></a>
<p>Man, I love the internet! Get this, I posted a rant about the
missing OS X 10.2 [aka Jaguar, aka. Jagwire] drivers for Alcatels
SpeedTouch USB ADSL modem [aka the squashed frog]. Later that day,
Jean-Pierre dropped me a note that he was working on a new version of
the drivers, but he only had instructions which included terminal
gymnastics and manual plist editing. A day goes by, and Jean-Pierre
drops me another note telling me that he has now made a new package of
the installer, which will install the edited drivers on your Jaguar <em>sans</em> terminal gymnastics. So, I test it on the 6C98 build of Jaguar, and it works flawless, out-of-the-box, and on the spot!</p>

<p>Jean-Pierres repackaged drivers [with french instructions - don't
worry, the installer uses the standard OS X installer interface] can be
downloaded <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/dl/SpeedTouch-USB-Jaguar.tgz">here</a> in a gnuzipped tarball (.tgz) format. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://aladdinsystems.com/">Stuffit Expander</a> should be able to decompress this with no problems.</p>

<p>So, in the words of Jean-Pierre, be your own hero today and install!</p>

<p><strong style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0%; color: rgb(255, 0, 0); -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;">DISCLAIMER:</strong> I have only tested these drivers on build 6C98 [<strong>not</strong>
the final release version of Jaguar] and only in Denmark [your country
and ISP might affect the functionality of the drivers]. They ought to
work on the final release though. However, downloading and installing
these drivers is your choice, and therefore your

<h2>Getting the cat online with the squashed frog</h2>
<a name="000346"></a>
<p>Yesterday JayPee was kind to react to my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/archives/2002/ind/spotted_quadrup2608.html">posting</a>
on the non-exsisting 10.2 drivers for the Alcatel SpeedTouch USB DSL
Modem (dubbed the Squashed Frog). Turns out JayPee found a way to cheat
the drivers, by changing the VPI/VCI parameters to those corresponding
to Denmark (where I am, you would have to change it to those
corresponding to where you are, obviously). It is not for the faint at
heart, we are talking manual plist editing, terminal.app acrobatics,
and similar stuff like that, so you'd wanna do it with steady hands and
a clean mind.</p>
<p>Haven't tried it yet, but I have an earlier build of Jaguar lying
around here somewhere, and I might try installing it to see what
happens. JayPee gave me these two links about the modem business. If
you try editing the drivers before me, please comment on this post, or
drop me a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/about.me#contact">message</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>Now, when people who did not write the drivers can find a way to
make it behave properly, does that signal a flaw on the side of the
producers, the ones who actually wrote the drivers? In Alcatels case, I
think that is exactly what it does. The OS X drivers for their DSL
modems are the epitomy of buggyness.<br>
In any other case, especially if it was my company who made the
software or drivers, I would make damn sure to hire the persons who
were able to edit the code, or at least write them a thank you note.

writes about the release of OS X 10.2 and all its bells and whistles.
He touches upon the topic of third party conflicts, and only mentions
complaints about a few mouse and printer drivers and a few small
shareware applications, but I'll add one more to the list. Alcatels
Speed Touch USB ADSL Modem won't work with Jaguar for a while, and
maybe it never will. Alcatel is not quite sure whether they will
release drivers for the SpeedTouch USB Modem at all! Guess who is the
owner of that modem? Me. What a pisser.</p>
<p>I just updated the drivers meself for the 10.1.5 release, and in spite of the horrible <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=12841&amp;db=mac">comments</a> it receives over at versiontracker, it works here, for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/archives/2002/ind/spotted_quadrup2608.html" title="Link me Baby!! - Posted by Jonas @ 12 in the AM CET">#</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=345" target="newWindow" onclick="OpenComments(this.href); return false"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="index_files/horn.gif" alt="Comment this

<p>I am not sure if these observations gives me a reason to conclude
any mindbending new universal facts, about how Danish news sites filter
out web robots from skimming their content. After the big lawsuit
against <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://www.adlawbyrequest.com/international/DeepLink071502.shtml">Newsbooster</a> i would have thought that they all had a huge robots.txt-file to keep search engines from indexing their content.</p>
<p>I guess they trust the law then.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/archives/2002/ind/to_hide_or_not_2508.html" title="Link me Baby!! - Posted by Jonas @  3 in the PM CET">#</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=344" target="newWindow" onclick="OpenComments(this.href); return false"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="index_files/horn.gif" alt="Comment this

<p>Last night was another tropical one of its kind, and with a gorgeus
moon. Made for a nice backdrop for hanging out on my balcony,
celebrating my newly discovered heat-caused insomnia. Conclusion? Heat
affetcs me in much the same way as girlfriend problems. Sleepless

headstart. Friday is the official introduction day followed by an

<li>Murphian law around here dictates it to rain whenever I put out
laundry to dry on my balcony. This time it really overdid it though,
the basement in my building got flooded.</li>
<li>Installing Xfree via <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> on OS X is hella time consuming, and renders XDarwin buggy at best. Probable error list: Me.</li>
<li>Installing leafnode via Fink, nukes your mysql user. Note to self: Make backups of tables regularly next time, mmkay?</li>
<li>You <strong>can</strong> have more than one tropical night a year in Denmark.</li>
<li>Large parts of the text to 'Strangling Me With Your Love' from
Defunkts "Thermonuclear Sweat" still puzzles me in more than one way.
Especially the bit about making love to a photo copy and leaving the
room in perfect order.</li>
<li>Leafnode and slrn (unix-blessings via Fink) is a nippy newsreader setup via <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://verture.net/thebox/slrn.png">terminal.app</a> (no, really, it is - thanks Morten!). I will concoct a how-to page in Danish, eventually.</li>
<li>Deep inside, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020902045222/http://kaboom.dk/">Rune</a> is a mac-user. Keep your head up brother, you'll get there!</li></ol>
