Greetings,

Google is currently blocked from crawling your site by the robots.txt
file that your server uses to control access by search engines. As a
result, users who are looking for your site are not able to find it
using Google. As you know, a large fraction of internet users use Google
as their starting point and over 50% of search engines referrals come
from Google. Google's mission is to deliver the best search experience
on the Internet by making the world's information universally accessible
and useful. We would like to include your site at http://wax.verture.net
in Google's index to make it easier for your users or customers to find
your site.  

To allow Google to crawl your site, add the following lines to the
robots.txt file: 

User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /

Once you have allowed Google to access your site it can take between 4-6
weeks for your site to appear in our index. For additional information
on getting your site included in our index, please see:
http://www.google.com/webmasters/.

Regards,
[DELETED]
